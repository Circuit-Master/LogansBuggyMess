```csharp
namespace WorldExplorationGame
{
    public static class Constants
    {
        public const int TileSize = 16;
        public const int ScreenHeightInTiles = 10;
        public const double MovementCooldown = 0.2; // Cooldown time in seconds
        public const int MovementSpeed = 1; // Movement speed in tiles
        public const float ScaleFactor = 4.0f; // Scale factor for textures
    }
}
